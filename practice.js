// Now we are going to start the topic related to

// Value types : We understand this by an example like we have physical document and one of our friedn 
// is take this and make some update but after your update the original document is remain unchanged. So that is callled value types objects

// Reference types : We can understand this by digital method of documentation , if we are sharing our duocument to ourn
// friend and he make same changes you will see the changes because you both lookig for a same file. So this is called reference type objets.
